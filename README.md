## ConvertKit Software Engineer Project

Welcome! ConvertKit's homework assignment is meant to be an approximation of work at ConvertKit. The tasks are a bit contrived,
but the concepts are things you may deal with on a day to day basis. We respect your time, and know that going through the hiring
process at multiple companies can be time consuming, so we request that you don't spend much more than two hours completing the assignment.
If you finish faster, great! If you get part of the way through, that's no problem either. You have the opportunity to explain any decisions
you made based on these constraints when you create your pull request.

## Instructions

We've set up `create-react-app` in this repo, and you should be able to get dependencies installed with `yarn install` and the app running with `yarn run`. If not, let us know and we'll help out. From here, we want you to build an app using the Spotify API and these features:

- A user can search for an artist, and see results as they type
- A user can click on an artist to see the artists top tracks

Everything about the implementation is up to you, including the use of `create-react-app`. If you're more comfortable with something else, feel free to use that. We recommend using the included [Spotify Web API JS](https://github.com/JMPerez/spotify-web-api-js) library to make requests to Spotify. Example authentication code is provided in `App.js`.

Once you're finished, create a Pull Request with your changes in this repo. Write a description of your code changes, including any decisions or tradeoffs you made. Since two hours is not a lot of time, include anything you would have done or changed given more time.

Have any questions? Please ask!
